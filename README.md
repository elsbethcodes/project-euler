## üßÆ Project Euler

This repository contains my personal solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems intended to be solved with creative problem solving and programming.

Solutions are required to have a runtime of less than 1 minute.

## ‚ú® Goal

My goal is to solve as many problems as possible by understanding the maths first, to minimise the reliance on code for a solution.

I aim to share my solutions to the first 100 problems. Permissions are not given to share solutions beyond the first 100 to allow others the joy of arriving at their answers themselves.

## üìÅ Structure

Each problem is in its own folder, labeled by its problem number.
