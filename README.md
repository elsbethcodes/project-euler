# 🧮 Project Euler Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), a collection of challenging mathematical and computational problems intended to be solved with creative problem solving and programming.

Solutions are required to have a runtime of less than 1 minute.

## ✨ My Goal

To solve as many problems as possible by understanding the maths first, to minimise the reliance on code for a solution.

## 📁 Structure

Each problem is in its own folder, labeled by its problem number.
